## Installation of Gurobi


    -   download from <https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/>

    -   register to get an academic
        [license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/).
        It will last three months.

    -   install Gurobi following the instructions at the [Quick Start
        Guide](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html)
        relative to your system. You can install all software via the (Ana)conda Python distribution. However, note that if you have already Python installed you may hand up having two distributions of it in your systems, which often creates confusion. Hence, the conda distribution is not recommended in this course.

    -   install the Gurobi Python Interface (`gurobipy`) following these
        instructions for
        [mac](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_mac/cs_grbpy_the_gurobi_python.html),
        [linux](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_linux/cs_grbpy_the_gurobi_python.html),
        [windows](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_windows/cs_grbpy_the_gurobi_python.html)
        (manual installation recommended)

    -   run 'grbgetkey' using the argument provided at the license
        registration page (ex: grbgetkey
        ae36ac20-16e6-acd2-f242-4da6e765fa0a). The 'grbgetkey' program
        will prompt you to store the license file on your machine (to do
        this step you must be within the SDU Net via [VPN connect](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/faellesomraadet/sdu_it/services/netvaerksadgang/vpn) ).
